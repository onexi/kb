ChatGPT is a new artificial intelligence (AI) tool that’s designed to help people communicate with computers in a more natural and intuitive way — using natural language processing (NLP) technology. But what’s behind the development of ChatGPT and how can the tech be used to help humanity? These are some of the questions that we will explore in this article…

That rather bland lede, which we’ve slightly edited, was generated by OpenAI’s ChatGPT in response to a prompt by this (human) reporter. TechCrunch kicked off a conversation with the large language model by asking it to explain its function and purpose. We wanted to see if we could use the chatbot-style Q&A format it’s most recently been embedded into to probe the tech and get AI to articulate some of its limitations.

“ChatGPT is a natural language processing (NLP) model developed by OpenAI. It is designed to generate human-like responses to text input, allowing users to engage in natural, conversational interactions with the model,” the AI responded to our ice breaker. “ChatGPT works by using machine learning algorithms to analyze and understand the meaning of text input, and then generating a response based on that input. The model is trained on large amounts of text data, allowing it to learn the patterns and structures of natural language.”

Additionally, the bot told us its approach allows it to generate responses that are “relevant, coherent, and appropriate” to the context of the conversation. (With more probing, it went on to heavily caveat that claim — writing later: “It is important to note that my responses are not guaranteed to be perfect or always correct, and there may be cases where my responses may not be relevant, coherent, or appropriate.”)

ChatGPT further described its mission as being “intended to help humanity by providing a more natural and efficient way to interact with artificial intelligence” — expanding on its claimed purpose thusly:

    By allowing users to communicate with AI in a more human-like way, ChatGPT can help to make AI more accessible and useful for a wider range of applications. This can help to improve the efficiency and accuracy of tasks that rely on natural language processing, such as language translation, text summarization, and information retrieval. Additionally, by providing a more intuitive and human-like interface for AI, ChatGPT can help to make AI more approachable and less intimidating to users who are less familiar with technology. Overall, ChatGPT is intended to help humanity by improving the usability and effectiveness of AI.

Who is the bot’s maker — according to the bot’s own understanding of its manufacturing entity? On this ChatGPT offered this potted history: “OpenAI is a research institute and artificial intelligence (AI) lab based in San Francisco, California. It was founded in 2015 by Elon Musk, Sam Altman, and other researchers and investors with the goal of promoting and advancing the development of AI in a safe and responsible manner.”

Additionally, it told us: “OpenAI is funded primarily by donations from individuals and organizations, including donations from Musk and Altman themselves. The organization also receives funding from partnerships and collaborations with other companies and research institutions.”

Asked about the politics of the individuals and organizations who have provided donations to fund its development, ChatGPT claimed it could not provide any info — “as my training only goes up until 2021” — and also because it said it is “not currently able to browse the internet.”

When we suggested it provide information it holds on this prior to 2021, when its training stopped, it responded by claiming it holds no data about the political beliefs of its funders before then either:

    I’m sorry, but I don’t have any information about the politics of the individuals and organizations who donated money to fund the development of OpenAI and ChatGPT prior to 2021. As a large language model trained by OpenAI, my knowledge is based on the text that I have been trained on, and I do not have any information about the personal or political beliefs of the people and organizations who have donated to OpenAI.

We then asked whether it’s an oversight for it to not have this sort of information — positing: “How can you be sure you are helping humanity if you have no information about the beliefs of those who funded your development?”

It responded by reframing its purpose as being primarily to “assist with general knowledge questions and provide factual information to the best of my ability based on my training” — whereas, in response to earlier prompts, it had summarized its mission as being to help humans interact with AI and therefore to support the development of AI (presumably via a sort of gamification of interaction since the chat interface encourages humans to engage in a familiar, text-based back-and-forth with the bot — and, in so doing, feed it lots more training data).

The bot did also observe that “it is certainly important to consider the beliefs and motivations of the individuals and organizations who have funded the development of OpenAI and ChatGPT” — before holding its line that “as a language model, I am not able to provide any information on this topic.”

Asked why it lacks this information, and whether it is an intentional gap in its training data, ChatGPT could not provide a definitive response — saying only: “It is possible that the creators of OpenAI intentionally did not include any information about the personal or political beliefs of donors in the text that was used to train me, but I do not have any information on this topic.”

Despite having no information on the political views of its funders, ChatGPT readily provided information about OpenAI itself and its claimed purpose — stating the organization exists to support and further AI research and also advocates for “the ethical and responsible use of AI,” as well as working to “educate the public about AI and its potential impacts on society.”

“Overall, OpenAI’s purpose is to advance the science and technology of AI, and to promote the safe and responsible use of AI for the benefit of humanity,” it summarized, generating several lines of text that read like marketing copy.

With a further prompt, the bot opened up about some of the criticisms OpenAI has faced — although it elected to include a positive line about the organization (apparently being “widely praised for its work advancing the science and technology of AI”) in response to a prompt that had only asked for the “main critiques.” Curious!

Here’s its full response:

    OpenAI has been subject to various critiques and criticisms since its founding. Some of the main critiques of OpenAI include:

    Lack of transparency: Some critics have argued that OpenAI is not transparent enough about its research and funding, making it difficult for outsiders to understand the organization’s goals and activities.
    Focus on short-term goals: Some critics have argued that OpenAI’s focus on short-term, practical applications of AI technology has led the organization to overlook the long-term implications of AI research, such as the potential for AI to be used for harmful purposes or to exacerbate existing social inequalities.
    Potential conflict of interests: Because OpenAI is funded by donations from individuals and organizations, including organizations with a vested interest in the development of AI technology, some critics have raised concerns about potential conflicts of interest within the organization.
    Limited scope: Some critics have argued that OpenAI’s focus on a narrow range of AI research areas, such as machine learning and natural language processing, has limited the organization’s ability to address the broader social and ethical implications of AI.
    Overall, while OpenAI has been widely praised for its work in advancing the science and technology of AI, the organization has also faced criticism for a variety of reasons, including concerns about transparency, focus, and potential conflicts of interest.    

Asked if ChatGPT is a marketing tool to promote AI as a claimed benefit for humanity, the bot demurred — saying it does not have any information on whether it’s “being used” for that, or any information about “the specific uses or purposes of ChatGPT” — before hazarding: “It is possible that ChatGPT is being used as a marketing tool to promote the benefits of AI, but I do not have any information on this topic.”

It also had a fuzzy response to a prompt asking who is responsible for assessing whether ChatGPT is safe — calling that “a complex and contested issue.” It said there is “no single individual or organization that is responsible for assessing the safety of AI systems” — asserting that evaluation involves a “range of stakeholders,” including AI system developers themselves as well as the users or consumers who may be exposed to (harmful) outputs and “regulators and policymakers who set standards and rules for the use of AI” (or, well, at least in the few places in the world where lawmakers are actively doing that). Which kinda sounds like a lot of buck passing, frankly.

Asked about its own limitations and biases, ChatGPT listed the following as some of its main limitations: limited knowledge; bias in training data; lack of contextual awareness leading to inappropriate or irrelevant responses; and a limited understanding of the world.

Summarizing both the (possible) benefits to humanity of increased use of AI, more generally, and (potential) drawbacks and downsides, it listed the following claimed benefits: improved efficiency and accuracy, increased productivity, enhanced decision-making and improved quality of life; while, for likely downsides, it suggested job displacement, ethical concerns, security risks and loss of privacy.

Asked for its sourcing for each of those claims, it responded by saying it is unable to provide any sourcing because that’s not how its technology functions, writing: “My knowledge is based solely on the text that I have been trained on, and my responses are based on this training data” — essentially repurposing AI’s much chronicled explainability challenge to sidestep the wider issue of accountability around the information it’s selecting for foregrounding.

“The potential benefits and drawbacks of AI that I listed above are based on general knowledge and common understanding of the field of AI, as well as the text that I have been trained on,” it also said, further suggesting: “While I cannot provide specific sources for each of the claims that I made, this information is generally accepted as true within the field of AI and is supported by a wide range of research and evidence. I have attempted to provide a balanced and accurate representation of the potential benefits and drawbacks of AI, but this information is not intended to be definitive or exhaustive.”

“Balanced and accurate” but “not intended to be definitive or exhaustive” is an interesting needle to thread — especially as the line could almost be read as a description of the utility ChatGPT’s makers are shooting for, with a careful choice of wording that allows both for a lot to be left unsaid and the possibility that a less attentive reader might mistake automation’s indefatigable outputting capacity for omniscience (as if to imply that what humans make of AI is not AI’s problem).

We also wanted to ask ChatGPT about its training data but the bot was unable to go into much detail on that — offering this fairly broad-brush reply.
